<h1>The Main Issue</h1>
<p>The primary issue with global house pricing is a combination of low supply and high demand, exacerbated by factors like inflation, rising construction costs, and increased incomes, leading to unaffordability for many.</p>
<h2>Demand Outstripping Supply:</h2>
<p>Globally, the number of houses being built is not keeping pace with population growth and migration, leading to a shortage and driving up prices. 
It occurs when the demand for goods and services outstrips the economy's ability to produce them. 
As more people want to buy things, businesses find themselves facing more orders than they can fulfill. As a result, they raise prices.</p>
<h2>Rising Construction Costs:</h2>
<p>Inflation and increased costs of materials and labor are making it more expensive to build new homes, further contributing to the supply issue. 
Global construction costs are forecast to rise 2-7% this year as geopolitical and economic uncertainty disrupt supply chains and increase prices. 
That's according to a new report from global cost and project management firm Currie & Brown.</p>
<h2>Increased Incomes and Low Unemployment:</h2>
<p>As incomes rise and unemployment rates fall, more people can afford to buy homes, increasing demand and pushing prices higher. 
Globally, while overall unemployment remains relatively stable, with the global unemployment rate at 5% in 2024, youth unemployment remains high, 
and informal work and working poverty persist, particularly in low-income countries, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). </p>
<h2>Impact on Affordability:</h2>
<p>The combination of these factors is making housing increasingly unaffordable for many people, especially in urban areas and countries with strong economic growth. 
Globally, rising housing costs and a shortage of affordable housing are creating a crisis, impacting 1.6 billion people by 2025 and potentially rising to 3 billion by 2030, according to the World Bank and UN-Habitat.</p>
<h2>And Geographical Variations:</h2>
<p>The housing crisis is not uniform across the globe. Some regions, like Asia, are experiencing some of the world's costliest and fastest-growing housing markets, 
while others, like some parts of Europe, are facing soaring rents. Geographical variations globally encompass differences in demographic characteristics, climate, 
biological traits, and more, across various regions and countries, influencing factors like population growth, environmental conditions, and species adaptation</p>

<div class="Why">
<h3>Why Is It An Issue?</h3>
<p>House pricing is a global issue because rising prices, driven by factors like low supply and high demand, make owning or renting a home increasingly unaffordable for many, 
impacting economic stability and social equity worldwide.</p>
<p>According to the 2023 International Housing Affordability Survey by Demographia, three out of the 10 least affordable housing markets are in Australia and New Zealand, 
two are in Canada and four more are located in the United States. The least affordable housing market is Hong Kong.</p>
